<h2>K Nearest Neighbors</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All of the already classfied cases are called neighbours to the new taken case.</li>
  <li>Classified case means it has a label assigned to it.</li>
  <li>With this method we want to assign the label to a new case based on the distance comparisong to all cases using distance function.</li>
  <li>K nearest neighbours means k as an amount of closest (similar with the value) cases,</li>

training samples - each sample is the set of featrues
test samples - based on test samples we want to predict labels based on a trained model 
training labels - for each training samples we have labels classified based on the sample's features
test labels - we are using test labels to compare them with prediction outcome - it assess the reliability of the model
